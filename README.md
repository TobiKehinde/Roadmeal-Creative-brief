# Roadmeal Creative brief

I created a creative brief and produced a social media ad based on the creative brief. 

**The goal** is to gain experience writing a brief to inform other teams of the objectives and specifications for an ad and to ensure clarity around the ad. 

The creative brief sets the tone and goals of an ad and ensures it matches the goals of a campaign or business.
I developed the brief to capture Roadmeal's target audience and business goals. The brief is found [here](Creative_Brief_for_Roadmeal.pdf).
